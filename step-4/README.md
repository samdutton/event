# Step 4

Add third party content.


## Objectives

* Include third party content.

* Check that third party content is functional in all target browsers and viewport sizes.

* Check effect of third party content on page layout in all target viewport sizes.

* Check effect on performance: file requests, page weight, load speed.

* Understand data cost.

* Check functionality and layout on slow connections.

* Understand testing techniques for all target browsers and viewport sizes.


## Things to check

* Does third-party content overflow or otherwise damage layout?

* Does third-party content work on poor connections?

* Is third-party content functional in small viewports on low-cost devices?

* How does third-party content affect page load, page weight and load speed?

* JavaScript API or iframe â€” which should you choose?
